- Before diving into the multi-stage pipeline processor, let's first understand the singlecycle processor. Then we can see why pipelining is important.

-  A Single Cycle RISC-V Processor is a basic CPU design in which every
instruction is executed in exactly one clock cycle.
- This includes all five stages of instruction execution: instruction fetch, decode,
execute, memory access, and write-back.



- Program:

```
main:
addi x1, x0, 5
addi x2, x0, 10
add x3, x2, x1
```

- No need to handle data, control, or structural hazards since there’s no overlap between
instructions.
- The clock cycle has to be long enough to finish the slowest instruction so faster
instructions waste time.
- Only one instruction runs at a time, so it’s slow overall.
